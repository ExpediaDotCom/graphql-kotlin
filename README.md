GraphQL Kotlin is a collection of libraries, built on top of [graphql-java](https://www.graphql-java.com/), that aim to simplify running GraphQL clients and servers in Kotlin.

Visit our [documentation site](https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin) for more details.

## üì¶ Modules

* [clients](/clients) - Lightweight GraphQL Kotlin HTTP clients based on Ktor HTTP client and Spring WebClient
* [examples](/examples) - Example apps that use graphql-kotlin libraries to test and demonstrate usages
* [graphql-kotlin-federation](/graphql-kotlin-federation) - Schema generator extension to build Apollo Federation GraphQL schemas
* [graphql-kotlin-schema-generator](/graphql-kotlin-schema-generator) - Code only GraphQL schema generation for Kotlin
* [graphql-kotlin-spring-server](/graphql-kotlin-spring-server) - Spring Boot auto-configuration library to create a GraphQL server
* [graphql-kotlin-types](/graphql-kotlin-types) - Core types used by both client and server
* [plugins](/plugins) - Gradle and Maven plugins

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

While all the individual modules of `graphql-kotlin` are published as stand-alone libraries, the most common use cases are running a server, and genereating a type-safe client.

### Server Example

A basic example of how you can use [graphql-kotlin-spring-server](/graphql-kotlin-spring-server) to run a GraphQL server can be found on our [server documentation section](https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin/docs/spring-server/spring-overview).

### Client Example

A basic setup of [graphql-kotlin-client](/clients/graphql-kotlin-client) can be found on our [client documentation section](https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin/docs/client/client-overview).

## üìã Documentation

More examples and documentation are available on our [documentation site](https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin) hosted in GitHub Pages. We also have the [examples](https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/graphql-kotlin/tree/master/examples) module which can be run locally for testing and shows example code using the libraries.

If you have a question about something you can not find in our documentation, the indivdual module READMEs, or [javadocs](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.expediagroup/graphql-kotlin-schema-generator), feel free to contribute to the docs or [start a disucssion](https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/graphql-kotlin/discussions) and tag it with the question label.
