# GraphQL Kotlin Client Example

Example GraphQL Kotlin client projects using Gradle and Maven together with a simple server to run against.

See documentation in individual modules for details how to run them

* [gradle-client](gradle-client)
* [maven-client](maven-client)
* [server](server)

> NOTE: Client examples are not part of the `graphql-kotlin-examples` project as they rely on the server to start up
before clients can be build.
