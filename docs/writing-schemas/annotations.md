`graphql-kotlin-schema-generator` ships with a number of annotation classes to allow you to enhance your GraphQL schema
for things that can't be directly derived from Kotlin reflection.

* [@GraphQLContext](../execution/contextual-data) - Autowire `GraphQLContext` from the environment
* [@GraphQLDescription](../customizing-schemas/documenting-fields) - Provide a description for a GraphQL field
* [@GraphQLDirective](../customizing-schemas/directives) - Registers directive on a GraphQL field
* [@GraphQLID](scalars#id) - Marks given field as GraphQL `ID`
* [@GraphQLIgnore](../customizing-schemas/excluding-fields) - Exclude field from the GraphQL schema
* [@GraphQLName](../customizing-schemas/renaming-fields) - Override the name used for the type
* Kotlin built in [@Deprecated](../customizing-schemas/evolving-schema) - Apply the GraphQL `@deprecated` directive on the field
